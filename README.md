# CSL_HCMC
Repository for the CityScope project related to Ho Chi Minh City Collaboration
***

## Phase 1 of project:
### Description:
The aim is to get familiar with City SCope, visualize a few fundamentals of urban design.  
At beginning, projects calculate 4 scenarios: [text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aUT-TAAsYP2-ipqvKKTmq-sOggkxeoe0/edit)
1. Existing Situation - 2021
2. Future built: same building shape with expected increase in density - 2030
3. Vision toward 2030 (Approved zoning plan in 2004) - 2030
4. Utiopian district -2030  

The updated version: 3 scenarios: The evaluation will be conducted in the same year 2021 :[text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iegZ8U6A3uy5qsTP9QaMTJLNPnZ92sJ9Ii7Numhpe30/edit)
1. Existing - 2021
2. Vision toward 2030 - 2021
3. Utopian district - 2021

### Folder Structure:
| Folder Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Data](https://github.com/CityScope/CSL_HCMC/tree/main/Data) | • A collection of raw data input shapefiles generated by GIS: Landuse, building, road network, OD matrix, POIs, etc. <br />• Census/ survey includes population, household income, age, mobility mode,.etc.<br />• Csv list work as intermediate linkages for module calcualtion |
| [Data_analysis](https://github.com/CityScope/CSL_HCMC/tree/main/data_analysis) | • Review survey data and set up intermediate data as input for module calculations<br />• Initial step of finding suitable size of table and number of cells<br />• Gravity model: Calculate corelation based on actual and prediction of OD Matrix |
| [Intermediate Output](https://github.com/CityScope/CSL_HCMC/tree/main/outputs) | A collection of outputs from data analysis. They are inputs for modules calculations |
| [Module](https://github.com/CityScope/CSL_HCMC/tree/main/modules) | This is where all indicators are calculated:<br /> • Gama Model<br /> • Spatial Model<br /> |
| [The Output](https://github.com/CityScope/CSL_HCMC/tree/main/scenarios) | • A saving text files for visualization in front end<br />• Code for static analysis of 3 scenarios<br />• Code to convert Shapefile (Landuse) to Geogrid |
